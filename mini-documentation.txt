#1. Global Styles with Styled Components:

Example: GlobalStyles.js file, the apply method in App.jsx

NOTE: 'GlobalStyles' does NOT accept any children components, so it must be just sibling component.

#2. &:

&: simply selects the currently selected element. Same thing as writing like html_element:hover.

Example: Button.jsx file

#3. css:
If we make some styling in separate variables, the syntax will NOT be highlighted. To make it highlighting, use 'css'.

Example: Heading.jsx file

#4. Props in Styled Components:
In App.jsx we are passing some props to Heading styled component. And in Heading.jsx we are accepting these props and do some operations.

NOTE: 'as' props. This prop is a part of Styled Components and needed to render this component AS some_html_element, it's very crucial for SEO and accessibility.
